# Tumelo Platform API Documentation

Tumelo's mission is to enable retail investors and pension members to create and benefit from a more sustainable investment system. 

We are a research, design and technology-focused team, driven by impact and based in Bristol.   

Tumelo partners with investment and pension providers, enabling them to provide their customers with transparency over the companies they own and a shareholder voice on issues they care about, such as gender equality, human rights or climate change. 

Our solution is white-label software delivered via APIs and/or a user-facing platform. Our software integrates with providers' existing platforms to drive customer engagement, acquisition and retention.

You will find the documentation for our API here. For information on how to access the platform see our [Getting Started](./Getting_Started/README.md) guide.
