# Stewardship API
The Tumelo Stewardship API provides access to information about the voting activities of fund managers in order to help pension schemes, investment managers and platform providers gain insights into the way they implement their voting rights.

The API supports retrieving three types of information:

* Information about Fund Managers themselves, including names and logos
* The voting history of the Fund Managers, including the voting rationale in the cases where the fund manager has provided this - most commonly when a vote occurs against the management recommendation
* The significant votes that the fund manager has identified

The [Fund Manger Votes](../Stewardship/Fund_Manager_Votes.md) section provides an example of how the APIs may be used to retrieve this information.
