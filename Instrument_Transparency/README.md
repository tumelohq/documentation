Instrument transparency provides [transparency](../What_is_Transparency/README.md) for a particular instrument, most notably composite instruments like for example an ETF fund. 

For a more direct view of exposure to organizations see the details around [organization breakdown](./OrganizationBreakdown.md), otherwise for a more granular and flexible view see the [instrument breakdown](./InstrumentBreakdown.md).
